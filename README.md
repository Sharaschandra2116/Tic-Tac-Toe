# Tic-Tac-Toe
This project implements a Tic Tac Toe game using an AI algorithm that ensures an unbeatable opponent. The AI uses techniques as the minimax algorithm to predict the best possible moves, making the game challenging and engaging for players. It serves as a demonstration of AI's capabilities in game theory and decision-making processes.
